# Exercise : 00 Easy find

-> create a function easyfind that accept a type T,
    it takes the first one has type T and the second has integer
        -> if the function find this a value return same value
        -> if the funtion doesn't find anything should return "error value of your choice" or exception

# Exercise 01: Span

-> create a Span class :
    -> that can store a maximum of N integers.
    -> N is an unsigned int
    -> will be the only parameter passed to the constructor
    -> create a function called addNumber() to add a single number
        . should order to fill it, Any attempt to add a new element if there
        . are already N elements stored should throw an exception.
    -> create function shortestSpan()
        . return the shortest span
        . or throw an exception
    -> create function longestSpan()
        . return the longest span
        . or throw an exception

* notice *
- Test your Span at least with a minimum of 10 000 numbers
- it would be wonderful to fill your Span using a 'range of iterators'

# Exercise 02: Mutated abomination

-> use std::stack containers
-> Write a MutantStack class 
    - It will be 'implemented in terms of a std::stack'.
    - I can use all iterators feature.
